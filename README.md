- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @codedNana
- ğŸ‘€ I randomly decided to teach myself how to code again. I mainly used matlab at uni and I was good at it, but I didn't enjoy it because I put too much pressure on my self. So now, I'm teaching myself how to build websites and trying to have fun with it.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning css
